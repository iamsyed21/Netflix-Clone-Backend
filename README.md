**NotFlix** is a detailed and high-fidelity clone of Netflix's front-end, designed to explore and understand the streaming platform's design principles. Although it mimics Netflix's user interface, it doesn't offer actual movie streaming. This project was undertaken to grasp the nuances of UI design and user experience, employing ES6 JavaScript for efficient and maintainable code.
